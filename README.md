# 1. Overview
 
## **Problem Definition**  
The primary issue in South African public schools, particularly in township and rural areas, is **twofold**:

**1.    Lack of Specialization and Skill Development:**  
- Most schools do not specialize in areas such as electronics, programming,arts and visuals, agricultural sciences,environmental management, basic carpentry, plumbing, engineering, Woodworking, etc.
- As a result, students graduate without practical skills or the ability to leverage their talents for economic independence.
- This leads to a workforce that is unprepared for the job market, contributing to high unemployment rates and socio-economic disparities.
  
**2.    Poor Infrastructure:**
- Many schools suffer from inadequate infrastructure, including unreliable water supply, pit toilets, and inconsistent electricity access.
- Poor infrastructure hampers effective teaching and learning, further exacerbating the skills gap and limiting students' future opportunities.

## **Objectives**  
  
**1. Highlight the Importance and Urgency:** 
- Use data to underscore the critical need for specialized education and improved infrastructure in South African public schools.

**2. Provide Actionable Insights:**
- Offer data-driven recommendations for decision-makers to prioritize interventions and allocate resources effectively.
- Suggest strategies to transition schools towards specialized education and improve overall infrastructure.

## **Motivation**
Many schools in my community lack specialization in crucial fields, leaving our graduates unprepared for the job market. This reality hits close to home, as I see talented students around me struggle to find their footing, contributing to high unemployment rates and socio-economic disparities. I urgently want to conduct a data analysis project to understand and address these gaps, so we can recommend actionable solutions that equip our youth with valuable skills, reduce unemployment, and foster a thriving, self-sufficient community.

## **Summary**  
  
Our exploratory data analysis focused on South African public schools, particularly in urban and rural areas.

**Findings include:**

**Learner and Educator Distribution:**

- **Significant variation** in the number of learners (0 to 3,233) and educators (0 to 372) per school, with **average** counts of 542 learners and 19 educators **(28:1)**, respectively.

**Population Across Provinces:**

- **Average** provincial population is 6,820,463, with considerable **variation** (1,294,044 to 16,266,595).

**Income Sources:**

- **Salaries/wages/commission** are the primary income source (51%), followed by **grants** (30%).

**Employment Status:**

- **Wide** regional disparities in employment, with **averages** of 1,941,827 **employed**, 997,709 **unemployed**, and 1,930,693 **not economically** active individuals.

**Educational Attainment:**

- **High completion rate** of **Grade 12 - Standard 10 - NQF4**, but steep **decline** in **higher education** attainment.

**Infrastructure Access:**

- **Significant digital divide**, with urban areas having much higher access to internet libraries, desktops/laptops, and electricity compared to traditional and farm settings.

**Commute Times:**

- **Most students** commute **within 31-60 minutes**, with **urban areas** showing a **broader range** of commute durations.

# Overview
 
### **Problem Definition**  
The primary issue in South African public schools, particularly in township and rural areas, is **twofold**:

**1.    Lack of Specialization and Skill Development:**  
- Most schools do not specialize in areas such as electronics, programming, agricultural sciences,environmental management, basic carpentry, plumbing, engineering, Woodworking, etc.
- As a result, students graduate without practical skills or the ability to leverage their talents for economic independence.
- This leads to a workforce that is unprepared for the job market, contributing to high unemployment rates and socio-economic disparities.
  
**2.    Poor Infrastructure:**
- Many schools suffer from inadequate infrastructure, including unreliable water supply, pit toilets, and inconsistent electricity access.
- Poor infrastructure hampers effective teaching and learning, further exacerbating the skills gap and limiting students' future opportunities.

## **Objectives**  
  
**1. Highlight the Importance and Urgency:** 
- Use data to underscore the critical need for specialized education and improved infrastructure in South African public schools.

**2. Provide Actionable Insights:**
- Offer data-driven recommendations for decision-makers to prioritize interventions and allocate resources effectively.
- Suggest strategies to transition schools towards specialized education and improve overall infrastructure.
